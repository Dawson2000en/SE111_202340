            <P> My name is Dawson Enright, I am 22 years old and live in Warwick, RI. 
                I have lived in Warwick my whole life. I have two sisters both are 26 years old.
                 They are not twins; one is not a biological sister. Our family adopted her when she was 10.
                 One of my favorite things to do is play soccer. 
                I have played soccer competitively since I was 8 years old. 
                I also love animals and have had bunnies, guinea pigs and dogs. 
                Right now, we currently have a guinea pig, two dogs and some fish. 
                I have been working at a pet store in Cranston, RI and enjoy working with the animals. 
                Fishing has always been a passion of mine and love to go out on a nice day and relax while catching fish, even if we don’t catch any it’s still a great relaxing day. 
                When I graduated from Pilgrim High School, I was not sure what I wanted to do next. After a couple years I knew that I needed to go to school to better my chances of getting a good job. 
                That is when I decided to go to New England Tech for Cyber Security. </p>
